## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install:

- Express.js (web server)
- CORS (cross-origin resource sharing)
- Puppeteer (for data scraping, if needed)

### Step 2: Ensure Data Directory Exists

Make sure you have the `2025 phase 1 data` directory with college subdirectories and CSV files. The structure should be:

```
2025 phase 1 data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ COLLEGE_NAME_1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BRANCH_1.csv
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BRANCH_2.csv
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ COLLEGE_NAME_2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BRANCH_1.csv
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BRANCH_2.csv
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Step 3: Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

Or for development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Search for results** using any of these methods:

   - Enter a student name in the search box
   - Enter a hall ticket number
   - Enter a college name
   - Use the dropdown filters for college, branch, or category

3. **View results** in the responsive table with sortable columns

4. **Export results** by clicking the "Export Results" button to download a CSV file

## Data Structure

Each CSV file contains student records with the following columns:

- `sno`: Serial number
- `hallticketno`: Student's hall ticket number
- `rank`: EAMCET rank
- `name`: Student's name
- `sex`: Gender (M/F)
- `caste`: Caste category
- `region`: Region (OU/AU/SVU/etc.)
- `seatcategory`: Seat category (OC_GEN_OU, BC_A_GIRLS_OU, etc.)

## API Endpoints

The application provides several REST API endpoints:

- `GET /api/colleges` - Get list of all colleges
- `GET /api/colleges/:collegeDir/branches` - Get branches for a specific college
- `GET /api/data/:collegeDir/:branchFile` - Get CSV data for specific college/branch
- `GET /api/all-data` - Get all data as JSON (optimized for frontend)
- `GET /api/stats` - Get statistics (total colleges, branches, records)

## Data Scraping

If you need to scrape fresh data from the official TS EAMCET website:

```bash
npm run scrape
```

This will run the `scraper.js` file to fetch the latest cutoff data.

## Customization

### Styling

- Modify the Tailwind CSS classes in `index.html`
- Adjust the space background and glass morphism effects in the `<style>` section
- Colors and animations can be customized in the Tailwind config

### Functionality

- Extend the API endpoints in `server.js` for additional features
- Customize the CSV parsing logic for different data formats

## Performance Optimization
